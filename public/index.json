[{"categories":["Crypto Currencies"],"contents":" Can you really earn crypto by doing your daily online activities?\n It\u0026rsquo;s a question that has intrigued many, including myself. While the concept seemed promising, the reality is a bit different.\nOver the past two years, I\u0026rsquo;ve put several apps to the test, and here\u0026rsquo;s what I have discovered:\nBrave browser: Next to very low crypto earnings for my browsing habits, one has to connect to a custodial wallet with a minimum withdrawal amount that I felt it would take a lifetime to reach.\nBitcoin Magazine App: Next to very specific topics covered, you would need to read appr. 750 articles to earn an equivalent of USD 1 in sats. The good thing is, one can withdraw almost any amount via the Lightning network.\nFountain Podcast App: Switching to this app, without changing my listening habits, proved to be more rewarding. You can earn sats that can be withdrawn at any time via the Lightning network. Fountain is my earn-crypto-on-the-go-winner-app.\nSo, back to the key question: How much have I earned within these two years?\nAnd the answer is a total of 51,974 sats, which is currently around USD 14 and could treat me to two cold beers at a nice bar by the lake.\nWhile this amount may not seem substantial, earning crypto through these apps is definitely a step in the right direction.\nSo, if you\u0026rsquo;re curious, give it a try and see what the crypto world has in store for you.\nHappy stacking!\n","permalink":"https://examplesite.org/blog/earn_crypto_on_the_go/","tags":["Daily Interaction with Crypto"],"title":"Earn Crypto on the go Debunked"},{"categories":["Fun time (Spanish edition)"],"contents":" Aprender tiene que ser divertido.

To the great disappointment of those who dream of becoming rich without getting out of bed, they are not.\n BTS is my abbreviation for Back to School. ETN stands for Education.  Without these, we can keep on hodling (special expression for holding bitcoin and other cryptos as a store of value) and dreaming of prices going up (\u0026ldquo;to the moon\u0026rdquo;).

It seems that the crypto community is highly engaged with topics appealing to many people with very diverse backgrounds.\n  NFTs (digital art) can be so much more than funny animals.\n  The Swiss National Bank is very well prepared for the blockchain future and has already its CBDC concept ready (including how to apply negative interest rates to it).\n  Despite plenty of free educational materials online, most organizations are still behind with their blockchain understanding. Nevertheless, different players such as governments, regulatory bodies, lawyers, tax advisors, and financial institutions explore this space. The significance of universities to drive awareness, understanding, and business adoption was highlighted during the sessions.\n  ","permalink":"https://examplesite.org/blog/crypto_valley_conference_2021/","tags":["Conference"],"title":"Back to the Future: Crypto Valley Conference 2021"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In what kind of world do we want to live?\n Dare to dream of a world where everybody has a say - a world where we can collaborate successfully without knowing each other. A world where business is carried out securely and transparently exposing corruption, fraud, and inefficiencies. A world where empowered individuals control their data and their destinies.\n Blockchain has been invented as an answer to this dream and proposes technical solutions to many of today\u0026rsquo;s challenges.\nHow does it work (light version)? A\tblockchain is a database that can store any type of information and transactions. Participants can add content but cannot go back and change the history. You can think of a chat group where every participant can add a message. If one participant drops, all others still have a copy of the data. Everybody sees the messages in real-time. The entire history of messages can be fully reconstructed. Blockchain can do the same for more complex transactions in a way more sophisticated shape and form.\nIn the blockchain, participants can add information that builds the blocks. The chain part of blockchain comes from the fact that the blocks are connected to each other.\nIn a blockchain, there is no corporation operating the network. Instead the group participants keep the network and its data alive. This makes a blockchain decentralized.\nIf somebody tries to falsify the data, other participants will notice it quickly and dismiss the manipulated version. This makes a blockchain immutable.\nIndividuals own their data, not corporations. Participants in the network can view data only if they have a special decryption key granted by the data owner. This makes a blockchain highly secure. Data privacy is ensured.\nThere are no entry barriers, and everybody can participate without any approvals required. This makes a blockchain truly inclusive.\nParticipants define in advance what good behaviour looks like and code it into the blockchain. Participants with special equipment (miners) monitor the behaviour on the blockchain, incentivize behaviour according to the rules, and sanction behaviour not observing the rules.\nIn a nutshell, blockchain is a solution that can improve both our private and our professional lives and open the door for new business models.\n","permalink":"https://examplesite.org/blog/blockchain_in_a_nutshell/","tags":["Blockchain","Future","Vision for the world"],"title":"Blockchain in a Nutshell"},{"categories":null,"contents":"A project I follow closely is the one from the Velocity Network Foundation.\nSeveral big companies, including SAP, Oracle, SHL, Korn Ferry, Randstad and Kelly Services, have joined forces to create a trusted open talent market - a blockchain solution providing fully verified CV information and credentials records.\n Here is the link to the Velocity Network Foundation.\n How will it work?\n•\tEmployers, educational providers, and credential issuers will upload data about achievements to the blockchain. In technical terms, it is only the hash uploaded, so no real data can be viewed by unauthorized persons or leaked incidentally. Only a person who has the key provided by the credential owner has access to the data. This ensures data is protected and compliant with regulations, such as the GDPR.\n•\tRecruiters can have access to a database of accurate, compliant, and verified applicant records.\n•\tCandidates will have full control over how their data is shared and used.\n•\tThe Velocity Network Foundation will establish the industry standards and ensure smooth product adoption. With their size, the critical mass will be reached rather quickly.\nWill this be the end of LinkedIn? We will see.\nHow about finding a gig on the blockchain? Braintrust is one of the biggest decentralized talent network. Freelancers find their cleints without any corporation between them. The platform is owned by the users. And this becomes visible with the paycheck.\n Check out the Braintrust platform.  Aetsoft is another company disrupting modern industries by offering blockchain based solutions for protecting sensitive personal data, improved hiring processes, and streamlined cross-border payroll.\n Excellent visualizations of how blockchain improves traditional HR processes can be found here Aetsoft.  In educational sector, blockchain has also its place. Swiss universities have incorporated Blockchain as a subject in the business and IT curricula. Some of them also accept bitcoin for payments.\nThe Basel University issues their certificates digitally on blockchain. The same is done also in Singapore and South Africa. This puts an end to the photoshopped credentials, as they can be verified immediately.\n","permalink":"https://examplesite.org/blog/blockchain_in_action/","tags":["Products","Business"],"title":"Blockchain in Action"},{"categories":null,"contents":" You don’t need to understand the technology behind blockchain in order to learn what can bring this technology to you. At the same time, if you start researching the topic on your own, you will encounter many terms explained below.\n To make complex topics easy, understandable, and fun, I use oversimplification and daily life analogies.\n•\tdApps are Apps which look the same for the end-user but are built on a blockchain. There is no company behind and no CEO. Instead, these networks are built, operated, and maintained by their users.\n•\tDecentralization: If there are as many owners as users, the power is shared among all participants. This ensures that only changes, that the majority of the users are in favor of, have a chance of being implemented.\nAs the old saying goes, do not put all eggs in one basket. This is what blockchain is doing. Every basket is a user. And data is spread across a large network of computers. If one of those computers stops working, the remaining computers store the same data and will ensure the blockchain functioning.\n•\tDistributed ledger technology (DLT) is an umbrella term for various technologies including blockchain.\n•\tImmutable: I bet people will notice it rather quickly if you try to remove a brick from a lower brick wall layer. The same goes for blockchain. Users can add transactions that are placed over one another in a brick wall style. Changing a record (tampering) from a lower layer of the blockchain will not go unnoticed and will be sanctioned by the users.\n• Interoperability: Do you work in an environment with many HR Systems which do not talk to each other and operate in silos? Most blockchains do not work across other blockchains yet. Latest generation blockchains are specifically designed to operate with other blockchains. This feature is called interoperability.\n•\tOpen Source: If you publish the receipt of your granny’s famous pumpkin pie, everybody will be able to replicate it. Open-source software works in a similar way: the code is published to serve the public for free, everybody will be able to read it, inspect it, recreate it, improve it, etc. As most blockchains are open source, shady functionalities such as user tracking or data collection become visible.\n•\tPeer-to-peer (P2P) network: When computers are connected directly to each other without a central server.\n•\tNFT (non-fungible token) is the digital certificate of ownership, e.g. contemporary digital art stored on a blockchain. Some people question the NFT value as art. Usually, NFTs are collectable items, e.g., animated animals, priced at several thousand USD, but it could be also music or a representation of a real-life object.\n•\tNon-custodial, also self-custodial: When you deposit your money in a bank, the bank uses it for investments, loans etc. If the bank misinvests, in the worst case scenario, you might even lose your money. Blockchain eliminates this risk, takes power away from the banks (and any other intermediaries), and gives it back to the owners, who are usually advanced users empowered to protect their data and their digital assets on their own.\n•\tSmart Contract: The conditions of a classical contract (if you deliver service X to me, I will pay you amount Y.) can be programmed on a blockchain. Once the event is confirmed, the payment (or the pre-agreed transaction) is triggered automatically with the nice side effect of being fast and cost-efficient.\n•\tTrusted intermediaries: These are the people we rely on to complete a transaction, e.g. banks, brokers, Uber etc. As the blockchain connects sellers and buyers directly, there is no need for any central party or trusted intermediaries. Have you heard about banking without banks, insurance without insurers, contracts without lawyers, publishing without publishers?\n•\tTrustless: It was very difficult for me to comprehend why trustless might be a positive feature. From a blockchain perspective, this term describes that blockchain transactions can be carried out without approval from a bank, lawyer, or any other middleman. Even if sellers and buyers do not know each other, the blockchain algorithm ensures that the transaction will be completed.\n•\tWeb3 (also «decentralized web», «fair internet», or “next-generation internet”): The concept is based on surprise surprise ;) blockchain, where the internet is a distributed network without any central player collecting, storing, and selling your data. Web3 “gives the power and the money back to the people.” Users control their own data. Users get paid for watching ads, for reading articles and playing games. Everybody can hold and transfer digital copyrights, digital currencies, digital art, etc., without the need for lawyers, financial institutions, or authorized dealers.\n","permalink":"https://examplesite.org/blog/key_blockchain_terms/","tags":[""],"title":"Key Blockchain Terms"},{"categories":null,"contents":"There are many scenarios where blockchain can add real value to HR.\n  Talent Acquisition Personal Data Security Payroll Employment contract conditions and benefits Audit Real-time reporting Unstable currencies Employee demand   Talent Acquisition Self-reported career achievements, unverified career records, or credentials in foreign languages might lead to misguided decisions.\nHow about if we validate those records and store them on a blockchain? Recruiters can receive access to this fully verified “digital identity\u0026quot;, which cannot be manipulated. This will improve the quality of the candidates, speed up the screening process, eliminate the need for background and reference checks.\nPersonal Data Security But why would candidates agree to store their records of skills, credentials and workplace performance on a blockchain? Because this is a highly secure encrypted solution where the candidates have full control over who can access their data. Using a special crypto password allows the candidate to choose who can view which part of their data.\nPayroll In cases of repetitive transactions such as contractors’ payments, payroll, etc., the conditions can be coded into a blockchain. The program is called a smart contract, and it is executed automatically in real-time.\nEmployment contract conditions and benefits Employment contracts might include specific payment conditions or waiting times for certain benefits. Examples could be:\n a) sign-on bonus after the successful completion of the probation period b) a certain percentage of salary increase after 1 year of employment c) allowances with a validity start date after a specified waiting period d) bonus calculation and payout based on predefined KPIs e) automated employee record deletion as per the applicable record retention policy  Instead of manually calculating and monitoring these cases, these conditions can be coded on the blockchain via smart contract. Once the condition is met, an automated procedure will be triggered, which will execute the pre-agreed outcome.\nAudit Instead of reviewing many copies of documents, auditors can receive access to the blockchain data and conduct a full audit instead of sampling. Blockchain makes data visible; transactions are traceable, approvals and payments are transparent and easy to reconstruct. As Blockchain is “immutable,” data cannot be overwritten or manipulated.\nReal-time reporting If all people\u0026rsquo;s data is stored on a blockchain, Headcount and other important metrics will be reconciled automatically without delay or extra effort.\nUnstable currencies High inflation is a concern for many people around the globe. An elegant solution to it could be a salary in cryptocurrency.\nEmployee demand More and more employees consider and proactively ask to receve at least a portion of their salary in cryptocurrency.
