### A very warm welcome to the future of HR from your host - an HR Professional, a Project Manager, a New-Ways-of-Working Ambassador and a Web 3 Citizen

Join me on my journey to explore blockchain and its use cases within the Human Resources function. 

From HR to HR.

My **Vision** is to liberate HR Professionals from the administrative burden and thus enable them to focus on empowering people to turn strategy into reality.

 The **Mission** of this website is to prepare curious minds for the future of HR by providing short and easily digestible knowledge bites on emerging technologies, particularly on Blockchain.

 **Disclaimer**: The opinions expressed here are of a newbie at the beginning of their blockchain study. My understanding has evolved already during the website creation, and it will continue evolving over time. 
 
 The content should be considered as an appetizer to learn more. I do not provide investment or managerial consulting advice. I do not represent any organizations and do not endorse any company, product or brand, unless specifically stated.
