### Hello, I am an HR Professional, a Project Manager and a Blockchain enthusiast

Join me on my journey to explore blockchain and its use cases within the Human Resources function. 

After more than 13 years learning the ins and outs of Human Resources on the job, I am going back to school to learn blockchain and find out how to marry those two and build a sustainable relationship. 


My **Vision** is to liberate HR Professionals from administrative burden and thus enable them to focus on empowering people to make their ideas reality.


 The **Mission** of this website is to prepare curious minds for the future of HR by providing short and easily digestible knowledge bites on emerging technologies, particularly on Blockchain.
