##### **Talent Acquisition**

Self-reported career achievements, unverified career records or credentials in foreign languages might lead to misguided decisions. 

How about if we validate those records and store them on a blockchain? Recruiters can receive access to this fully verified “digital identity" which cannot be manipulated. This will improve the quality of the candidates, speed up the screening process, eliminate the need for background and reference checks.

##### **Personal Data Security**

But why would candidates agree to store their records of skills, credentials and workplace performance on blockchain? Because this is a highly secure encrypted solution where the candidates have full control over who can access their data. By using a special crypto password, the candidate can chose who can view which part of their data. 



##### **Payroll**

In cases of repetitive transactions such as contractors’ payments, payroll etc., the conditions can be coded into a blockchain. The program is called smart contract and it is executed automatically in real time.


##### **Employment contract conditions and benefits**

Employment contracts might include specific payment conditions or waiting time for certain benefits. Examples could be:


1. sign-on bonus after the successful completion of the probation period
2. certain percentage of salary increase after 1 year of employment
3. allowances with validity start date after a specified waiting period
4. Bonus calculation and payout based on predefined KPIs
5. Automated employee record deletion as per the applicable record retention policy  

Instead of manually calculating and monitoring these cases, these conditions can be coded on the blockchain via smart contract. Once the condition is met, an automated procedure will be triggered which will execute the pre-agreed outcome. 



##### **Audit**

Instead of reviewing many copies of documents, auditors can receive access to the blockchain data and conduct a full audit instead of sampling. Blockchain makes data visible, transactions are traceable, approvals and payments are transparent and easy to reconstruct. As Blockchain is “immutable”, data cannot be overwritten or manipulated


##### **Real-time reporting**

If all people data is stored on a blockchain, Headcount and other important metrics will be reconciled automatically without any delay or extra effort. 


##### **Employees without bank accounts**

The so called unbanked people (without access to Financial services) can get paid in cryptocurrency via mobile phone apps.
