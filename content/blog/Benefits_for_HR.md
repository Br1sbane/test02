There are many scenarios where blockchain can add real value to HR.



> 1. Talent Acquisition
> 2. Payroll
> 3. Employment contract conditions and benefits
> 4. Audit
> 5. Real-time reporting

1. **Unverified candidate CVs (Talent Acquisition)**
Self-reported career achievements, unverified career records or credentials in foreign languages might lead to misguided decisions. 

Once validated records, history of employment and personality assessments are stored on a blockchain, they cannot be manipulated. Recruiters can receive access to this compliant “digital identity". This will improve the quality of the candidates, speed up the screening process, eliminate the need for background and reference checks.

But why would a candidate agree to store their record of skills, credentials, and workplace performance on blockchain? Because it is securely encrypted and they have full control over who can access the data. By using a special crypto password, the candidate can share the data on the need to know basis. 



**Payroll** 
In cases of repetitive transactions such as contractors’ payments, payroll etc., the conditions can be coded into a blockchain. The program is called smart contract and it is executed automatically in real time.

One day, when employees will be paid in cryptocurrencies, a rule can be coded to pay out salaries at the end of each working day without the need for additional administration.



**Employment contract conditions and benefits**
Employment contracts might include specific payment conditions or waiting time for certain benefits. Examples could be:
1)	- sign-on bonus after the successful completion of the probation period
2)	- certain percentage of salary increase after 1 year of employment
3)	- allowances with validity start date after a specified waiting period
6)	- Bonus payout based on predefined KPIs
7)	- Automated employee record deletion as per the applicable record retention policy  

Instead of manually calculating and monitoring these cases, these conditions can be coded on the blockchain via smart contract. Once the condition is met, an automated procedure will be triggered which will execute the pre-agreed outcome. 



**Audit**
During audits, HR is required to present a lot of documents. With blockchain, no additional work will be required. Auditors can receive access to the blockchain securely and real time. Blockchain makes data visible, transactions are traceable, approvals and payments are transparent and easy to reconstruct.  
As Blockchain is “immutable”, data cannot be overwritten. Instead each record can be updated with a clear proof of who has updated what and when. This would reduce cases of document manipulation, falsified data and fraud.


**Real-time reporting** 
If all people data is stored on a blockchain, Headcount and other important metrics will be reconciled automatically without any delay or extra effort.
