> You don‚Äôt need to understand the technology behind in order to understand what the technology can bring you. At the same time, when you start researchin the topic yourself, you will encounter a lot of terms which I will explain below. 

For the sake of making complex topics easy understandable and fun, I make extensive use of oversimplification, analogies and humour üòâ


‚Ä¢	**dApps**
 are exactly as Apps, just built on a blockchain. There is no company behind and no CEO. Instead, these networks are built, operated, and maintained by their users.


‚Ä¢	**Decentralization**: As the old saying goes, we should not put all our eggs in the same basket. The same goes for blockchain. The encrypted data is spread across a large network of computer storage spaces.  


‚Ä¢	**Distributed ledger technology (DLT)** is another word for blockchain.


‚Ä¢	**Immutable**: In a WhatsApp group, everybody can write, but one cannot change the messages of others. If I would like to correct my message, I would write another message and everybody can see the entire history of messages. The same goes for blockchain. Records will be updated with clear traceability. 

‚Ä¢**Interoperability**: Within HR, we are familiar with the problem of having too many HR Systems which do not talk to each other and operate in silos. The same goes for blockchain. Most blockchains do not work across other blockchains. Some of them are specifically designed to operate with other blockchains. The feature of blockchains being able to talk to each other is called interoperability.  


‚Ä¢	**Open source**: If you publish the receipt of your granny‚Äôs famous pumpkin pie, everybody will know it, will be able to check the ingredients and will be able to make it. Open source software works in a similar way: if the code is published, everybody will be able to read it, inspect it, recreate it, improve it etc. The advantage is that one can have full overview if data is being collected without users knowledge or any other ‚Äúmonkey business‚Äù is going on.     


‚Ä¢	**Peer-to-peer (P2P) network**: When computers are connected directly to each other without a central server. 


‚Ä¢	**Metaverse**: Virtual spaces where users live their lives online e.g. Zoom conferencing, virtual assessment centers, job interviews, gaming worlds etc. 


‚Ä¢	**Non-custodial**: As blockchain is decentralized, there is no company behind it securing your assets on your behalf and no hotline to turn to. Instead, each user is the owner of their digital assets incl. their own data and they take care of the security.


‚Ä¢	**Smart Contract**: The rules of a classical contract (if you deliver service X to me, I will pay you Y amount. If the flight is cancelled, a pre-agreed compensation is paid out.) can be programmed on a blockchain. Once the event happens, the condition e.g. payment is triggered automatically. This happens much faster, without any administration and without fees for intermediaries. 


‚Ä¢	**Trusted intermediaries**: These are the people who we rely on to complete a transaction e.g. banks, brokers etc. The promise of blockchain is to eliminate these completely. You might have heard: Banking without banks, insurance without insurers, contracts without lawyers, selling music without publishers. The blockchain connects seller and buyer directly without any central party. 


‚Ä¢	**Web3** (also ¬´decentralized web¬ª, ¬´fair internet¬ª or ‚Äúnext generation internet‚Äù): If you have enough from Facebook, Google and others tracking every step you take, you will love the Web3 vision (realization in early stages). The concept is based on blockchain where internet is a distributed network without any central player collecting, storing and selling your data. Web3 ‚Äúgives the power back to the people‚Äù. Users control their own data. They can hold digital copyrights, digital currencies, digital art etc. and transfer them to other users without the need for lawyers, banks or authorized
