> You don’t need to understand the technology behind blockchain in order to learn what can bring this technology to you. At the same time, if you start researching the topic on your own, you will encounter a lot of terms which will be explained below. 

For the sake of making complex topics easy understandable and fun, I make extensive use of oversimplification and daily life analogies.

•	**dApps**
 are Apps built on a blockchain. There is no company behind and no CEO. Instead, these networks are built, operated, and maintained by their users.


•	**Decentralization**: As the old saying goes, do not put all eggs in one basket. This is what blockchain is doing. Every basket is a user. And data is spread across a large network of computers. If one of those computers stops working, the remaining computers store the same data.


•	**Distributed ledger technology (DLT)** is another word for blockchain.


•	**Immutable**: If you try to remove a brick from a lower layer of a brick wall, I bet, people will notice it rather quickly. The same goes for blockchain. Users can add transactions which are placed over one another in a brick wall style. Changing a record (**tampering**) from a lower layer of the blockchain will not go unnoticed and will be sanctioned by the users.  

• **Interoperability**: Do you work in an environment with many HR Systems which do not talk to each other and operate in silos? Most blockchains do not work across other blockchains. Latest generation blockchains are specifically designed to operate with other blockchains. This feature is called interoperability.  


•	**Open source**: If you publish the receipt of your granny’s famous pumpkin pie, everybody will be able to replicate it. Open source software works in a similar way: if the code is published, everybody will be able to read it, inspect it, recreate it, improve it etc. The advantage of it is that undesired functionalities such as users tracking or data collection will be visible. 


•	**Peer-to-peer (P2P) network**: When computers are connected directly to each other without a central server. 


•	**NFT** (non-fungible token) is contemporary digital art stored on a blockchain. Some people question the NFT value as art. Usually, NFTs are collectible items e.g. animated animals priced at several tausend USD.  


•	**Non-custodial, also self-custodial**: When you deposit your money in a bank, the bank uses it (without asking you) for investments, loans, bankers bonuses. If the bank misinvests, in worst case scenario you might even lose your money. Blockchain eliminates this risk, takes the power away from the banks (and any other intermediaries) and gives it to the owners who are usually advanced users empowerd to protect their data and their digital assets on their own.  


•	**Smart Contract**: The conditions of a classical contract (if you deliver service X to me, I will pay you amount Y.) can be programmed on a blockchain. Once the event is confirmed, the payment (or the preagred transaction) is triggered automatically with the nice side effect of being fast and cost efficient.  


•	**Trusted intermediaries**: These are the people who we rely on to complete a transaction e.g. banks, brokers etc. The promise of blockchain is to eliminate these completely. You might have heard: Banking without banks, insurance without insurers, contracts without lawyers, publishing without publishers etc.. The blockchain connects sellers and buyers directly without the need for any central party. 


•	**Trustless**: It was very difficult for me to comprehend why trustless might be a positive feature. From blockchain perspective, this term describes the fact that blockchain transactions can be carried out without an approval from a bank, lawyer or any other middleman. Even if seller and buyers do not know each other, the blockchain algorithm ensures that the transaction will be completed.    


•	**Web3** (also «decentralized web», «fair internet» or “next generation internet”): If you have enough from being tracked across all your smart devices, you will love the Web3 vision. The concept is based on surprise surprise blockchain where internet is a distributed network without any central player collecting, storing and selling your data. Web3 “gives the power back to the people”. Users control their own data. They can hold and transfer digital copyrights, digital currencies, digital art etc. without the need for lawyers, banks or authorized dealers.
