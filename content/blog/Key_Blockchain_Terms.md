> You don’t need to understand the technology behind in order to understand what the technology can bring to you. At the same time, when you start researching the topic yourself, you will encounter a lot of terms which will be explained below. 

For the sake of making complex topics easy understandable and fun, I make extensive use of oversimplification and daily life analogies.

•	**dApps**
 are exactly as Apps, just built on a blockchain. There is no company behind and no CEO. Instead, these networks are built, operated, and maintained by their users.


•	**Decentralization**: As the old saying goes, do not put all eggs in one basket. This is what blockchain is doing. Every basket is a user. And data is spread across a large network of computers. If one of those computers stop working, the remaining computers store the same data.


•	**Distributed ledger technology (DLT)** is another word for blockchain.


•	**Immutable**: Everybody can put a brick on a brickwall. But if you try to remove one brick from a lower layer and replace it with another, everybody will notice it and will disagree with the change. The same goes for blockchain. Users can add transactions, but changing a record (**tampering**) will not be possible.  

• **Interoperability**: Within HR, we are familiar with the problem of having too many HR Systems which do not talk to each other and operate in silos. The same goes for blockchain. Most blockchains do not work across other blockchains. Some of them are specifically designed to operate with other blockchains. The feature of blockchains being able to talk to each other is called interoperability.  


•	**Open source**: If you publish the receipt of your granny’s famous pumpkin pie, everybody will be able to replicate it. Open source software works in a similar way: if the code is published, everybody will be able to read it, inspect it, recreate it, improve it etc. The advantage of it is that any potential “monkey business" such as collecting user data will be visible. 


•	**Peer-to-peer (P2P) network**: When computers are connected directly to each other without a central server. 


•	**Non-custodial, also self-custodial**: As blockchain is decentralized, there is no company behind it securing your assets on your behalf. Also there is no hotline to turn to when you lose your password. Instead, owners educate themselves how to take proper care of their digital assets.


•	**Smart Contract**: The conditions of a classical contract (if you deliver service X to me, I will pay you amount Y.) can be programmed on a blockchain. Once the event happens, the condition e.g. the payment is triggered automatically with the nice side effect of being fast and cost efficient.  


•	**Trusted intermediaries**: These are the people who we rely on to complete a transaction e.g. banks, brokers etc. The promise of blockchain is to eliminate these completely. You might have heard: Banking without banks, insurance without insurers, contracts without lawyers, publishing without publishers etc.. The blockchain connects sellers and buyers directly without the need for any central party. 


•	**Web3** (also «decentralized web», «fair internet» or “next generation internet”): If you have enough from being tracked across all your smart devices, you will love the Web3 vision. The concept is based on blockchain where internet is a distributed network without any central player collecting, storing and selling your data. Web3 “gives the power back to the people”. Users control their own data. They can hold and transfer digital copyrights, digital currencies, digital art etc. without the need for lawyers, banks or authorized sellers.
