 A thought provoking podcast questioning the status quo ways of working in Finance:  A 10 min episode [The Accountant Quits](https://theaccountantquits.com/episode-6-why-are-accountants-not-being-taught-information-technology/)

One of the first non-technical book on the topic I have read: [The Future of everything by Michael J. Casey](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34964890-the-truth-machine).

Andrew (Andy) Spence is one of the few Thought Leaders in Blockchain for HR and author of the Whitepaper "Blockchain and the CHRO. Transforming the HR Function and the Market for Skills, Talent, and Training". His latest conference appearance [Blockchain, Decentralized Workforce and what it means for the Future of Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FctcybuXZ3o) can be found on Youtube.

If you prefer a very gentle entry into the topic, you might opt for the young adults cryptocurrency novel [Strength in Numbers by Bill Laboon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38953582-strength-in-numbers).

One of the classical free online courses is from the [Saylor Academy, Bitcoin for everyone](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468).

Several free self-paced online courses are available under [EDX.Org](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS170x+2T2021/home). 

The braver ones can try out the lectures of [the Web3 Foundation, Blockchain Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8YyZELnVaw&list=PLxVihxZC42nF_MCN9PTvZMIifRjx9cZ2J).
