The future is now and my first live contact with the blockchain community was the Crypto Valley Conference 2021 at the HSLU in Rotkreuz. 








Here are my impressions under the following topics:


> 1. Hype vs. value creation
> 2. Crypto community
> 3. NFTs (digital art) 
> 4. Traditional institutions 
> 5. Education

1. There are many high-tech products out there, and one has to look closely to distinguish the hype from the real value for the enterprises.   

2. Local politicians, bankers, CEOs, academia, artists, private investors, and students were amongst the guests. It seems that the **crypto community is highly engaged** with topics appealing to many people with very diverse backgrounds. 

3. **NFTs (digital art)** can be so much more than funny animals.

4. The **Swiss National Bank** is very well prepared for the blockchain future and has already its CBDC concept ready (including how to apply negative interest rates to it). 

5. Despite plenty of free educational materials online, most organizations are still behind with their blockchain understanding. Nevertheless, different players such as governments, regulatory bodies, lawyers, tax advisors, and financial institutions explore this space. The significance of **universities** to drive awareness, understanding, and business adoption was highlighted during the sessions.
