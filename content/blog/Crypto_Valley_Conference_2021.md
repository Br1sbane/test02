My first live contact with the blockchain community was the Crypto Valley Conference 2021 in at the HSLU in Rotkreuz. 








Here are my impressions under following topics:


> 1. Stakeholders
> 2. Crypto community
> 3. Audience focus 
> 4. NFTs (digital art) 
> 5. Traditional institutions

1. Local politicians, regulators, lawyers, bankers, CEOs, academia, educators, artists, private investors, students were amongst the guests. Involving a wide range of **stakeholders** will ensure common understanding and adoption.   

2. If I compare the participants of the Crypto Valley conference with the PMI Project Management Conferencece, it becomes clear that there was a **highly engaged crypto communnity** with topics appealing to many young people with very diverse backgrounds. Also the attendance was 4 times higher than the Project Management conference. 

3. Successful business people can turn an exciting topic into a deadly boring presentation by ignoring their **audience**.  

4. **NFTs (digital art)** can be so much more than funny animals.

5. A traditional institution such as the **Swiss National Bank** is very well prepared for the blockchain future and have already their concept of CBDCs. 

6. The significance of **universities** to drive awareness, understanding and business adoption continues to be high.
