The future in now and my first live contact with the blockchain community was the Crypto Valley Conference 2021 at the HSLU in Rotkreuz. 








Here are my impressions under the following topics:


> 1. Hype vs. value creation
> 1. Stakeholders
> 2. Crypto community
> 3. Audience focus 
> 4. NFTs (digital art) 
> 5. Traditional institutions 
> 6. Education

1. There are many high-tech products out there, and one has to look closely to distinguish the hype from the real value for the enterprises.   

1. Local politicians, bankers, CEOs, academia, artists, private investors, and students were amongst the guests. If you compare this with the strong opposition from other governments or traditional institutions, **stakeholder management** in Switzerland has been brought to a new level.   

2. Compared to the participants of the PMI Project Management Conference, it seems that the **crypto community is highly engaged** with topics appealing to many young people with very diverse backgrounds. 

3. Even if you are a successful businessman/woman, you can still turn an exciting topic into a deadly boring presentation by not considering your **audience**.  

4. **NFTs (digital art)** can be so much more than funny animals.

5. A traditional institution such as the **Swiss National Bank** is very well prepared for the blockchain future and has already its CBDC concept ready (including how to apply negative interest rates to it). 

6. Despite plenty of free educational materials online, most organizations are still behind with their blockchain understanding. Nevertheless, different players such as governments, regulatory bodies, lawyers, tax advisors, and financial institutions explore this space. The significance of **universities** to drive awareness, understanding, and business adoption was highlighted during the sessions.
