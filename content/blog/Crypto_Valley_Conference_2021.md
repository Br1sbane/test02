My first live contact with the blockchain community was the Crypto Valley Conference 2021 at the HSLU in Rotkreuz. 








Here are my impressions under following topics:


> 1. Stakeholders
> 2. Crypto community
> 3. Audience focus 
> 4. NFTs (digital art) 
> 5. Traditional institutions 
> 6. Education

1. Local politicians, bankers, CEOs, academia, artists, private investors and students were amongst the guests. If you compare this with the strong opposition from other governments or traditional institutions, **stakeholder management** in Switzerland has been brought to a new level.   

2. Compared to the participants of of the PMI Project Management Conferencece, it seems that the **crypto community is highly engaged** with topics appealing to many young people with very diverse backgrounds. 

3. Even if you are a successful businessman/woman, you can still turn an exciting topic into a deadly boring presentation by not taking into consideration your **audience**.  

4. **NFTs (digital art)** can be so much more than funny animals.

5. A traditional institution such as the **Swiss National Bank** is very well prepared for the blockchain future and has already their CBDC concept ready. 

6. Despite plenty of free educational materials online, most organizations are still behind with their blobkchain understanding. Nevertheless, different players such as governmnents, regulatory bodies, layers, tax advisors and finance institutions start exploring this space. The significance of **universities** to drive awareness, understanding and business adoption was highlighted during the sessions.
