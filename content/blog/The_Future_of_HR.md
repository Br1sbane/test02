> **this text already exist**The mission of this website is to prepare curious minds for the future of HR by providing short and easily digestible knowledge bites on emerging technologies, particularly on Blockchain.

As new technologies bring more and more changes to the daily HR work, HR professionals have the choice:

They can either continue working the traditional way and witness how their skills become obsolete or they can proactively educate themselves on these emerging technologies and actively participate in the development of the new ways of working. 

I believe in the power of the HR Professionals evolving in the wake of emerging technologies. And despite the fact that so much educational information is available for free, the barriers to enter the blockchain space are rather high, mostly due to the technological, rather complex language used. 

On this website, I will be explaining what blockchain can bring to the HR function in a way that HR colleagues can understand and will enjoy ðŸ˜Š. 

By embracing the blockchain concept, not only will we evolve as HR Professionals, but we will also reinvent the employee experience. 

Get ready for the future of HR!
