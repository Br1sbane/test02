When my generation turns the retirement age, pension funds will most probably be empty or melted away by inflation.

If scientists live up to their promise that we will be living for 100 years, would that mean that my peers and myself will be working for another 50 or 60 years? 

And if so, how to plan for such a timeframe?  



My answer is clear: Invest in **BTS** and **ETN**.

What might sound like cryptocurrencies, to the great disappointment of those who dream of becoming rich without getting out of bed, is not.

1. BTS is my abbreviation for **Back to School**.
1. ETN stands for **Education**.

Without these, we can keep on hodling (special expression for holding crypto) and dreaming of crypto prices shooting to the moon. And for most of us, the dream will stay just a dream. 

Tomorrow, I am going back to school to equip myself with the knowledge and practice required for the blockchain age.

Constant upskilling and reskilling is the most crucial factor to stay relevant in the blockchain world and in the job market.  

And this is the best investment advice not only for 2021 but for your entire life.
