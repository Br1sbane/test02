> Can you really earn crypto by doing your daily online activities? 


It's a question that has intrigued many, including myself. While the concept seemed promising, the reality is a bit different. 

Over the past two years, I've put several apps to the test, and here's what I have discovered:

**Brave browser**: Next to very low crypto earnings for my browsing habits, one has to connect to a custodial wallet with a minimum withdrawal amount that I felt it would take a lifetime to reach.

**Bitcoin Magazine App**: Next to very specific topics covered, you would need to read appr. 750 articles to earn an equivalent of USD 1 in sats. The good thing is, one can withdraw almost any amount via the Lightning network.

**Fountain Podcast App**: Switching to this app, without changing my listening habits,  proved to be more rewarding. You can earn sats that can be withdrawn at any time via the Lightning network. Fountain is my earn-crypto-on-the-go-winner-app. 

So, back to the key question: How much have I earned within these two years? 

And the answer is a total of 51,974 sats, which is currently around USD 14 and could treat me to two cold beers at a nice bar by the lake. 

While this amount may not seem substantial, earning crypto through these apps is definitely a step in the right direction.

So, if you are curious, give it a try and see what the crypto world has in store for you. 

Happy stacking!
