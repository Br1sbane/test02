A project I follow closely is the one from the **Velocity Network Foundation**.

Several big companies, among others SAP, SHL, Korn Ferry, Randstad, Kelly Services, have joined forces to create a trusted open talent market - a blockchain solution providing fully verified CV information and credentials records.  



> Here is the link to the [Velocity Network Foundation](https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation).


How will it work? 

•	Employers, educational providers and credential issuers will upload achievements to the blockchain directly, while making sure it is protected and compliant with regulations, such as the GDPR.

•	Recruiters can rely on accurate, compliant, and verified records.

•	Candidates have full control over how their data is shared and used.  

•	The Velocity Network Foundation will ensure smooth product adoption and that the crititcal mass is reached.
