A project I follow closely is the one from the **Velocity Network Foundation**.

Several big companies, among others SAP, SHL, Korn Ferry, Randstad and Kelly Services, have joined forces to create a trusted open talent market - a blockchain solution providing fully verified CV information and credentials records.  



> Here is the link to the [Velocity Network Foundation](https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation).


How will it work? 

•	Employers, educational providers and credential issuers will upload achievements to the blockchain directly, while making sure data is protected and compliant with regulations, such as the GDPR.

•	Recruiters can have access to a database of accurate, compliant, and verified applicant records.

•	Candidates will have full control over how their data is shared and used.  

•	The Velocity Network Foundation will establish the industry standards and ensure smooth product adoption. With their size, the critical mass will be reached rather quickly.

Currently, they offer advanced solutions for protection of sensitive personaö data, improved hiring processes and streamlined cross-border payroll. 

What is next on Aetsoft roadmap? Digital Identity solution with the potential to "remove borders between the EU states".
