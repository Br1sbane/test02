A project I am following closely is the Velocity Network Foundation.

Several big companies, among others SAP, SHL, Korn Ferry, Randstad, Kelly Services, have joined forces to create a blockchain solution providing fully verified CV information and credentials records.  



> The website

How will it work? 

•	Employers, educational providers and credential issuers will upload achievements to the blockchain directly. 

•	Recruiters can rely on accurate, compliant, and verified information.

•	Candidates have full control over how their data is shared and used while making sure it is protected and compliant with regulations, such as the GDPR. 

•	The Velocity Network Foundation will work on change management and adoption of the solution.
