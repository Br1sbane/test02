A project I follow closely is the one from the **Velocity Network Foundation**.

Several big companies, including SAP, Oracle, SHL, Korn Ferry, Randstad and Kelly Services, have joined forces to create a trusted open talent market - a blockchain solution providing fully verified CV information and credentials records.  



> Here is the link to the [Velocity Network Foundation](https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation).


How will it work? 

•	Employers, educational providers, and credential issuers will upload achievements to the blockchain directly while ensuring data is protected and compliant with regulations, such as the GDPR.

•	Recruiters can have access to a database of accurate, compliant, and verified applicant records.

•	Candidates will have full control over how their data is shared and used.  

•	The Velocity Network Foundation will establish the industry standards and ensure smooth product adoption. With their size, the critical mass will be reached rather quickly.

Will this be the end of LinkedIn? We will see. 

How about finding a gig on the blockchain? **Braintrust** is the first decentralized talent network. Freelancers find their cleints without any corporation between them. The platform is owned by the users. And this becomes visible with the paycheck.

**In educational sector**, blockchain has also its place. Swiss universities have incorporated Blockchain as a subject in the business and IT curricula. Some of them also accept bitcoin for payments.  

The Basel University issues their certificates digitally on blockchain. The same is done also in Singapore and South Africa. This puts an end of the photoshopped credentials, as it can be verified immediately.
