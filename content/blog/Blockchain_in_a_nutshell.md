In what kind of world do we want to live? 

>  Dare to dream of a world where everybody has a say - a world where we can collaborate successfully without knowing each other. A world where business is carried out securely and transparently exposing corruption, fraud, and inefficiencies. A world where empowered individuals control their data and their destinies. 

Blockchain has been invented as an answer to this dream and proposes technical solutions to many of today's challenges.

##### How does it work (light version)?

A	blockchain is a **database** that can store any type of information and transactions. Participants can add content but cannot go back and change the history. You can think of a chat group where every participant can add a message. If one participant drops, all others still have a copy of the data. Everybody sees the messages in real-time. The entire history of messages can be fully reconstructed. Blockchain can do the same for more complex transactions in a way more sophisticated shape and form.

In the blockchain, participants can add information that builds the **blocks**. The **chain** part of blockchain comes from the fact that the blocks are connected to each other.  

In a blockchain, there is no corporation operating the network. Instead the group participants keep the network and its data alive. This makes a blockchain **decentralized**. 

If somebody tries to falsify the data, other participants will notice it quickly and dismiss the manipulated version. This makes a blockchain **immutable**.  

Individuals own their data, not corporations. Participants in the network can view data only if they have a special decryption key granted by the data owner. This makes a blockchain **highly secure**. **Data privacy** is ensured.

There are no entry barriers, and everybody can participate without any approvals required. This makes a blockchain **truly inclusive**.

Participants define in advance what good behaviour looks like and code it into the blockchain (**consensus algorithm**). Participants with special equipment (**miners**) monitor the behaviour on the blockchain, incentivize behaviour according to the rules, and sanction behaviour not observing the rules. 

In a nutshell, blockchain is a solution that can improve both our private and our professional lives and open the door for new business models.
