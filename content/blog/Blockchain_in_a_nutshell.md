In an mobile app chat group, every participant can add a message. 

If one mobile phone loses the data, all other phones still store it. 

One cannot manipulate the entries and everybody sees the messages in real-time. 

The entire history of messages can be fully reconstructed. 


> Imagine the same for more complex transactions. Welcome to the world of blockchain!

A	blockchain is a **database** which can store any type of information and transactions.

In blockchain, participants can add information which build the **blocks**. The **chain** part of blockchain comes due to the fact that the blocks are connected to each other.  

In blockchain, there is no corporation operating the network. Instead the group participants keep the network and its data alive. This makes a blockchain **decentralized**. 

If somebody tries to falsify the data, other particpants will notice it quickly and will dismiss the manipulated version of the data. This makes a blockchain **immutable**.  

Participants in the network can view the data only if they have a special decryption key granted by the data owner. This makes a blockchain **highly secure**.
