In what kind of world do we want to live in? 

>  Dare to dream of a world where everybody has a say. A world where we can trust each other. A world where data and transactions are carried out in a secure and transparent way, exposing corruption, fraud and inefficiencies. A world where empowered individuals control their data and their destinies. 

Blockchain was invented as an answer to this dream and proposes technical solutions to many world issues.

##### How does it work?

A	blockchain is a **database** which can store any type of information and transactions. Participants can add content, but cannot go back and change the history. You can think of a chat group where every participant can add a message. If one paricipants drops, all othersn stillave a copy of the data. Everybody sees the messages in real-time. The entire history of messages can be fully reconstructed. Blockchain can do the same for more complex transactions in a way more sophisticated shape and form.

In blockchain, participants can add information which build the **blocks**. The **chain** part of blockchain comes from the fact that the blocks are connected to each other.  

In blockchain, there is no corporation operating the network. Instead the group participants keep the network and its data alive. This makes a blockchain **decentralized**. 

If somebody tries to falsify the data, other particpants will notice it quickly and will dismiss the manipulated version of the data. This makes a blockchain **immutable**.  

Participants in the network can view the data only if they have a special decryption key granted by the data owner. This makes a blockchain **highly secure**.

There are no entry barriers and everybody can participate without any approvals required. This makes a blockchain **truly inclusive**.

Participants define in advance what good behaviour looks like and code it into the blockcchain (**consensus algortithm**). Participants with special equipment (**miners**) monitor the bahaviour on the blockcahin, incentivize behaviour according to the rules and sanction behaviour not following the rules. 

In a nutshell, blockchain is a solution addressing several problems at once.
